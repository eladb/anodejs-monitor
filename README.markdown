This service is an HTTP ping service that pings a set of targets once in a while and collects ping stats.
It also has a UX that shows latency graph for a specified target.

See code for API (sorry).

# TBD

The evolution of this service is to use *pushqueue* in order to generate requests.
See the *pushqueue* github page.
